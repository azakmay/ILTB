       " <p><strong><span style=\"color: #00aaff\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">Patrick: </span></span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\"><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"157\" href=\"/?startTime=157\"></a><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"157\" href=\"https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/71195566/lynn-finding-your-customers?startTime=157&amp;btp=be113ee7\">[00:02:37]</a> </span></span><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">So I always try to begin these conversations with some kind of fun. In this case, I thought it'd be interesting to ask you, if you were to go back to your alma mater, which was Mizzou undergrad, we were just talking about a place that I've spent a lot of time in Columbia, Missouri, and you had -- you were forced to teach, I'll call it like a 401 level course, a single course to a group of students who have opted into it, that's not a beginner's course, that's an advanced course of some type. What do you think you'd do a great job teaching?</span></span></strong></p>,\n",
       " <p><strong><span style=\"color: #d82292\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">Rebecca: </span></span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\"><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"185\" href=\"/?startTime=185\"></a><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"185\" href=\"https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/71195566/lynn-finding-your-customers?startTime=185&amp;btp=be113ee7\">[00:03:05]</a> So I probably wouldn't do nuclear engineering, which is some of what I did when I was there. I'd probably would go back and teach start-up 101 and force everyone into really thinking out of the box and starting a company. And what I learned recently through my daughter, who's only 16, is that it almost doesn't matter in a way what your idea is because you're going to learn so much just by going through that process.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">My daughter, Hazel, she came home, and she said, \"Hey, my friend and I want to start a dog running business.\" And I was like, okay. And I almost said no, like that's not super interesting. But then I listened, I learned to listen three more beats typically. And she said, \"Hey, our advantage is that we're going to run the dogs and actually exercise them,\" and she is a cross-country runner. And I said, okay, and she said, \"Hey, can you spend some time with me and my friend while we do this?\"</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And so they actually formally booked time on my calendar, and they came in and they had their whole plan. And it was so fascinating because what I take for granted I realized is not sometimes intuitive. We talked all about supply and demand and how to run a meeting, how to run an effective meeting, how to make decisions, how to have accountability, how to try different channels?</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And what you try first, second and third on how to go-to-market and acquire supply and demand and then how to have a customer promise that resonates and deliver that promise and then how to have an umbrella concept like, \"Hey, we're going to exercise your sort of obese dog,\" which is what she's getting their request for. And in reality, the dog probably is just going to walk, but they're offering the running part of it, right, as their higher-level benefit.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And I was just fascinated because I thought, wow, I think a lot of us in our careers take for granted what our knowledge base is. And I just realized how incredibly important it is for anyone to learn these concepts and how they do translate from a dog running business to autonomous cars, and I think it's just really fascinating because it almost challenged people just to pick any idea and let's just go through it because the building blocks and the things you asked, and the foundational elements are all the same.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><strong><span style=\"color: #00aaff\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">Patrick: </span></span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\"><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"320\" href=\"/?startTime=320\"></a><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"320\" href=\"https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/71195566/lynn-finding-your-customers?startTime=320&amp;btp=be113ee7\">[00:05:20]</a> </span></span><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">What is the umbrella concept?

That just tends to be who Procter &amp; Gamble likes to hire. And so I worked at P&amp;G and learned a lot about marketing and branding and product market fit and all that when I was there. But you typically lead with this umbrella concept, like your highest tier product. That's always what people advertise.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">So in every category, you'll offer your highest tier, your biggest benefit and that umbrella kind of captures everything underneath it. Their example, we're going to run your dog and make that dog incredibly fit and it's aspirational. It's aspirational offering that you can give to somebody, but then typically, you have other products underneath that, that they all kind of ride under that umbrella and that bigger, higher-level promise.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><strong><span style=\"color: #00aaff\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">Patrick: </span></span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\"><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"370\" href=\"/?startTime=370\"></a><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"370\" href=\"https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/71195566/lynn-finding-your-customers?startTime=370&amp;btp=be113ee7\">[00:06:10]</a> </span></span><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">What else from the P&amp;G experience or a set of lessons from that time of your career do you think applies most to the kinds of companies you spend your time with now that may not be typical Silicon Valley start-up lore?</span></span></strong></p>,\n",
       " <p><strong><span style=\"color: #d82292\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">Rebecca: </span></span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\"><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"382\" href=\"/?startTime=382\"></a><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"382\" href=\"https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/71195566/lynn-finding-your-customers?startTime=382&amp;btp=be113ee7\">[00:06:22]</a> Marketing, marketing and marketing. So it's really interesting. At Procter &amp; Gamble, most of the marketers and product people I worked with were chemical engineers. And to figure out what products we were going to offer our consumers, we actually developed pretty big models to model out which variable had the biggest factor effect, what we were going to do to the product to move more cases out the door essentially.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And it really varied by geography. So in Mexico versus Japan versus Germany versus Canada and even in different parts of the United States, you had very different consumer preferences, even for things like laundry detergent and toilet paper, believe it or not. And I could talk to you all day about the differences in like, Charmin, in the U.S., Canada and Mexico and Germany, it's fascinating what those different consumer preferences might be.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And what Procter &amp; Gamble teaches you is humility that what you think really doesn't fucking matter, about the end product, right? And it's hilarious because the biggest fallacy in Silicon Valley is that some CEO just knows. Steve Jobs just knew how to do something. Well, Steve Jobs was brilliant and amazing and had an incredible instinct that he did do a lot of consumer testing.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And so at P&amp;G, what they teach you is how to listen to the consumer. They teach you the humility of you probably can't predict it. We would all have bets when we tried new versions of products and pretty much whatever the engineer or the really smart brand person would bet on, usually would come in the last.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">So you learn this humility about how to listen and ask the consumer. The other thing you learn is that not everything can be accomplished in quantitative testing, like we did tons of quant analysis and then modeled -- actually physically modeled those results. I've actually not seen very many people in Silicon Valley do that.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And at P&amp;G too, on the quant side of the world, you damn well better know what your confidence interval and your base size is if you're talking to anybody about X versus Y winning. That's the kind of language I actually had to instill into my marketing teams because they don't naturally do that in Silicon Valley.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">But when you pull somebody out of Procter &amp; Gamble or American Express or Capital One, that's how they do it. They know how to set up very defined designs of experiments where you can do multivariate testing, and they know their way around statistics. So oftentimes, when I'm recruiting on that quant side, I actually will really look for someone with an economics background because you'd be surprised how many engineers really can't do stats.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">Anyway, so back into the qualitative piece of it. One thing that people miss out here too is that if you're designing a totally new concept and something people haven't seen before. And let's just take my old P&amp;G days, the disposable diaper or Febreze which was a really hard thing. It might take them years to nail the marketing message on Febreze, absolutely years.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And when you're trying to come up with something that doesn't exist, people can't react to it unless you let them see, touch and feel it, right? You have to have like a concept and use test. And you can't ask people what would you think of X if it doesn't exist. For example, what would you think of a coffee cup with two handles? Well, they've never seen a coffee cup with two handles. So they can't really tell you in a quantitative test what that might be like for them.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">You can ask them how you want to incrementally improve something, like make it softer, make it stronger, make it work faster or something like that. But you can't ask consumers to conceptualize brand-new things without letting them experience them and get any kind of real read. And then the design of the survey is so incredibly important. Doing things like saying, do you like this versus do you like this, or not, will actually result in about a 10% difference in negative responses.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">The people out here often do surveys that they don't have the training oftentimes to do that. People in the political realm often deal with polling or people who come from CPG, but I'll sit in a board meeting or sit with the marketing team and people will tell me, \"Oh, this didn't work, or this did work.\" And then at the end, I'm like, \"I want to see every piece of copy, I want to see every test cell and how many did you test? Where was it placed? What time of day?\"</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And what's really amazing to me and it's almost always true is that a lot of the conclusions they have drawn, especially for what didn't work were not based on solid testing methodology. So maybe they tested on too low of a base size, maybe they had really different places they tested. Maybe they copy, you look at the copy and you're like, \"Oh, wow, I see why that didn't work.\" And so it's really interesting. And I wish that we had more of that core marketing CPG kind of ethos here.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">It's interesting, too, when you look at Intuit. The founder of Intuit was from Procter &amp; Gamble, Meg Whitman as well, with eBay, was from P&amp;G. And you see their touch on things. Everything out here is done a little differently. It's more of a focus on like growth and features. It's just like feature, feature, feature in terms of when people are trying to sell their product and message it. And what I really try to push people into is the higher-level need. What is the benefit?</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><strong><span style=\"color: #00aaff\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">Patrick: </span></span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\"><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"726\" href=\"/?startTime=726\"></a><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"726\" href=\"https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/71195566/lynn-finding-your-customers?startTime=726&amp;btp=be113ee7\">[00:12:06]</a> </span></span><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">What kind of questions have you found effective to tease that out of someone building a product. Like how do you suss that out with someone talented that's smart and on to something, but may not have that messaging down yet?</span></span></strong></p>,\n",
       " <p><strong><span style=\"color: #d82292\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">Rebecca: </span></span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\"><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"740\" href=\"/?startTime=740\"></a><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"740\" href=\"https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/71195566/lynn-finding-your-customers?startTime=740&amp;btp=be113ee7\">[00:12:20]</a> Usually, my first question is how many consumers have they spoken to and which consumers and what did they learn? What surprise them when they talk to the end consumer and what did they learn about it? Oftentimes, they have spoken to the consumer, but sometimes it's been a little while.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And sometimes, when they did speak to an end consumer, they only spoke to the person that loves their product or that hates their product sometimes. Sometimes they just end up on the support calls. And it's really important to get a spectrum of people who love you, who just kind of like you, who are pissed off at you, who haven't tried you and sort of get that whole gamut and really understand the consumer.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And I have to tell you, it is probably shocking but shouldn't be shocking that oftentimes, they have an assumption of who their consumer is and it's not right. For example, I was in a fintech start-up, the CEO told me we have a millennial audience, dudes essentially and we are helping them with their finances. I won't name names or anything like that.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And I was kind of looking at their product, thinking, I don't think so, right? And I said, I bet you that your product is probably middle-aged women. And it's not because I'm so smart, it's because that too kind of handles the finances for people in the household. And when I was looking at what was happening in the app, sure enough, was like women do for household finances.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And so they were like you're crazy. And I said, okay, I could be crazy. I'm often crazy, but let's just find out. And sure enough, we did the survey and guess what? The average age was late <a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"40\" href=\"/?startTime=40\">40s</a> or early <a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"50\" href=\"/?startTime=50\">50s</a>, female had financial household. And it was interesting because our marketing was so sort of bro focused, right, and feature focused.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And we were able to, through that exercise, really shift it over to addressing our target audience. And so what felt like kind of pushing a rock uphill suddenly felt much easier when we had the right messaging for who we were serving. And there's always a question, too, who's our customer today, who do we want to be our customer and who's our customer tomorrow and then also the P&amp;G experience of customer life cycle management.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">The hardest company to be in, is the company where you have to re-acquire the consumer every single time. What you really have to think about is what is that customer value life cycle? How do I capture somebody when they're a baby and go all the way up till they're married, had a household, retired, the whole bit. And what is that life cycle like, how are we meaningful and how do we keep that consumer the whole time?</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And not just serve that particular consumer for a point in time or a point in their life because the true cost is the acquiring of the customer. So that brings us right into account management and sort of customer life cycle management, which is also incredibly important to focus on in an early-stage and a later-stage company once, importantly, you have enough customers to actually manage.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><strong><span style=\"color: #00aaff\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">Patrick: </span></span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\"><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"933\" href=\"/?startTime=933\"></a><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"933\" href=\"https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/71195566/lynn-finding-your-customers?startTime=933&amp;btp=be113ee7\">[00:15:33]</a> </span></span><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">You referred a number of times this kind of overlapping theme of respect for the customers' point of view and identifying who they are and asking questions a certain way of them. And the survey seems like an interesting device in the midst of all this. What are like the top 3, I guess, I'll call them like sins of the survey, like a couple of things that people tend to do totally wrong when they're running one of these things, whether it's in tactics or strategy?</span></span></strong></p>,\n",
       " <p><strong><span style=\"color: #d82292\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">Rebecca: </span></span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\"><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"956\" href=\"/?startTime=956\"></a><a class=\"bt-timecode\" data-bt-time=\"956\" href=\"https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/71195566/lynn-finding-your-customers?startTime=956&amp;btp=be113ee7\">[00:15:56]</a> One thing is there are certain kinds of products that surveys will get you nowhere and possibly the wrong answer. I learned this kind of the hard way. When I came out of Procter &amp; Gamble, I had this crazy job at P&amp;G, I reported to the global head of the entire category, right, and help launch new products. And then I got that at an incredibly early age at Procter &amp; Gamble. So I had tons of great exposure, right?</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">So I came out to Silicon Valley, wanted to work at a start-up. So I took this role heading a product at a company called NextCard, and we were the first online credit card company. And this was back in the stone ages where you bounced servers at midnight. You literally did sleep all night at the office because if the code didn't role at midnight, you had to roll back before the East Coast woke up.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And I say that because I came in and thought I had a great bag of tricks and said, \"Hey, we're going to do surveys on credit card products.\" And my CEO, who was a very experienced financial person from a bank called Providian, said, \"Over my dead body, we're going to do that.\" And I said, \"Well, I don't understand. This is how we do things.\" He said, \"Not in financial services because there is a judgment.\"</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And I thought about it, and I'm like, you're right because we had to be really careful about this, especially with some products at P&amp;G. And so whenever there's a judgment about how somebody should think, feel or act, you stay away from surveys. So in other words, if you ask somebody, do they pay their bills on time, it's a judgment. People feel they should answer that question in a certain way. So oftentimes, quantitative surveys can really lead you astray.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And if you ask them something more hardcore, like, hey, what's your credit score? They can kind of give you a ballpark range because that doesn't really imply much of a judgment. But do you do something where you've been told you should do it all the time, do you balance your checkbook, what people will say they do and what the reality is are two different things.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">That's the number one sin at quant surveys is that they ask questions where consumers infer there's a judgment and then people don't understand the bias that's interpreted in that. So it's always like what people do versus what they say. So that's where we say, okay, we'll just test it, right? Just throw out some splash pages. Let's just run it and test it and just get a real read on it. That's a better way to do those things, but it's really hard.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">How much of a product do you actually make to let them see, touch and feel to test versus just ask. P&amp;G had some really great concept in use test. So we would send mocked up product out into the hands of consumers where they could actually get their hands on it and use it and then we'd ask them questions.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And so it's hard to instill that at my company and say, well, put some splash pages out there, let's just run with a minimum viable product and just get some feedback because a lot of times, people will say, \"Oh, do you like this? Would you use this?\" They are like, \"Oh, of course, I would use that.\" Yes, that makes so much sense because they should. It's just same thing in health care. Do you track your diet? Do you exercise? How many drinks do you have, right? Let's just take that one. How many drinks do you have?</span></span></p>,\n",

That's pretty awesome. The go-to-market council came about, and it really has always been about, but we just formalized it, I would say. And the reason we did is that we were all talking over many conversations about when companies won, when companies like LendingClub or Doximity or Luminar or a whole host of these companies, like when they won, what mattered, what did we do that was different? And how can we do that more and better?</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And I thought about it, and I was like, well, it's marketing, marketing and marketing. And it's funny because marketing kind of has this weird name sometimes with engineers. A lot of people don't even understand what marketing is in a way or maybe they just have a different definition. So often when I'm talking to engineering people, they think it's just like PR or something like that and only that.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">But for me, marketing is how many cases out the door, how many units of your product are you selling, right? And so when it's been really successful, it's when we have gone in and we've seen sort of the essence of this product market fit. There's a product, the dogs are kind of eating the dog food, but it's limited.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">Maybe they're just doing Facebook ads or maybe they're on Insta or maybe they're on Google or maybe they're even targeting their own consumer right now, but we're seeing some glimmer and then we go in and spend a good amount of time with the CEO and the team and often a day, a week for a while and figure out really where the opportunity might lie and then we help them hire that team and get those resources and stand them up.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">An example of this is Gabi, the insurtech company that was sold to Experian. And we went in, and they were offering an insurance product where people could find the best car insurance. And the reason I loved it is that it followed the adage that I learned at P&amp;G, my favorite adage is don't make me think. So in the consumer realm, if you're selling to a consumer, if you make them think or you make them make a decision, you will shoot yourself in the foot.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">Like just make it brain-dead simple. Just like Apple, like Apple is the most amazing company, and I would argue that's a huge piece of their success is they don't make you think. Everything is as it should be. And the reason everything is as it should be is they ask thousands of people what it should be, right? And they figure it out.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">So with Gabi, you could just enter basic information and they had a very amazing AI team on the background to figure out what car insurance you should have with minimal, minimal data entry and they could compare apples to apples. And then every year, they could just update it for you, right? And you didn't have to think about it. This company, when we came in, they were doing good marketing, but it was very basic at that point in time.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">It was more buying AdWords or things like that. And when we got in there, I said, \"You know what, you have a complete mass market product.\" The product was ready to go in terms of its ease of use. Oftentimes, you come into a company, and you want to start marketing it and you find out, well, I have to work on the product and especially the funnel. And for a little bit at Gabi, we did improve the funnel.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">Then what we did is we had an executive and resident with us that had done a lot of direct-to-consumer, he helped build out sort of Dollar Shave Club. And I brought him in, and I said, let's think about this, right? We ended up taking Gabi on television as pre-Series B, believe it or not. And it worked. It completely worked, but it worked because we had the right product, we had the right adviser that helped us and that we brought in. And then after they raised their Series B, this person took over and became their Chief Marketing Officer and then thereafter they sold to Experian.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">That's just one example of helping a company really refine their funnel, find a brand-new channel and find the right person. It's always about the person, I think, at the end of the day to help them execute this. And also the resources, we used an agency that I had worked with quite a bit in the past. And so we looked at that, and we had several other examples of similar things that we have done. That's the kind of work we do with the go-to-market council.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">So we looked at our companies, what kind of help do they need, and we interviewed, oh my gosh, a couple of hundred people actually that were known to be experts in their field in different areas of go-to-market. And it could be positioning and content. It could be enterprise sales, it could be growth hacking, product-led growth, it could be direct marketing, whatever we kind of made a list of what the companies we had in our portfolio needed and matched to those skill sets.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And importantly, we found people that not only weren't too senior, but also had seen just a crazy growth in their past. And an example is -- Graham Chalfant is one example, who had been at One Medical. Another one, one of my favorites, Allan Ng who was, I think, the first marketing person at Livongo. He's now at Freenome, and he's helped a number of our companies with their positioning and their go-to-market like in the health tech space.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">It's interesting because when you look at it from like a company perspective, like a Series A or B company, these are people they couldn't afford to hire. And quite frankly, if they hire them, they wouldn't know what to do quite yet. They would want to hire people or hire a team. But having them involved in their company for a few hours a week or whatever is amazing. It's just like a strategic adviser who was like on the ground at that point in time.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And then we had a few cases where that person has then joined the company. So Nick Fairbairn, who was in this role and then joined Gabi and Graham Chalfant, joined Airvet. We have that model. And for me, that's really what matters. So when we have a Series A company and they kind of had the semblance of product market fit, what they need to do between there and the Series sort of C is find their channels and grow and have a marketing team.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And so what's the most fun is getting them from $0 to $10 million in revenue and then $10 million to $100 million in revenue. And that's almost never done in a single or even a couple of different channels. What I did at NextCard and what I've done in my life is you need to have a channel mix. And you need multiple levers to pull.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And so when you're running marketing, you have to have different things you can tap at different times. If one channel is having challenges for some reason, you need another channel to go into. And so you need to have that flexibility to do that. And that's what we try to help our companies achieve pretty early on.</span></span></p>,\n",

There's other places that are usually broken too. But typically, that's almost always broken initially, where the salesperson goes and sells a deal, and then success has to pick it up. And then for some reason, there's a miscommunication in that process or there's not a complete understanding and it takes too long to set the customer up.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">The customer is not the right customer for some reason, they didn't really have a good understanding of what their ideal customer look like. So it takes some work. I mean I went into my company, I figured, right, which was an AI and machine learning and helped them with this a lot and actually took over as the CEO for a bit and learned this firsthand again on the ground is that that's usually broken in some way.</span></span></p>,\n",

And so you really have to be clear about your incentive program. So the salespeople have to do so many deals, so much revenue. They sign those contracts and they're done. And then the success people, oftentimes they're maybe not incentive-based comp or maybe more like an anti-churn kind of thing.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And in reality, ownership can't stop from the sales group and so I think they're stood up. That customer has stood up because that feedback loop is super necessary. And so a lot of times it's really a simple thing. It's just not incentivizing the sales team or maybe extra incentivizing that in a meaningful way once that customer has gone live. And then also, on the other hand, bringing that customer success person forward into the sales process to do a sanity check on is this a customer that's going to be good for us or not.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And it's normal. People kind of beat themselves up over this, but they shouldn't because everyone gets it wrong initially because you're starting a new company, you have a new product, you might not know who your ideal customer is at first. And the really, really, really hard, the critical thing for everyone to do is say no to some people. That's really the second question I ask is, how many customers have you said no to?</span></span></p>,\n",

And oftentimes, it's because they weren't ready yet. The customer wasn't ready yet. They weren't their ideal customer, and it's really hard. It's hard to talk to an early-stage CEO who has a massive company like Walmart or Apple or TikTok that wants to come work with them and tell them that that's a really bad idea right now. And it's just the timelines don't meet, and a lot of things don't meet, and it's like that's super flattering, but that's kind of for a day later when we're a little bit further along.</span></span></p>,\n",

What is great positioning accomplished in your mind? What is positioning? Why is it important? How do you define great in that skill?</span></span></strong></p>,\n",

It makes the executives decide what they are not. And it's critical. When I look at companies across the board, there are very few companies, even if they're a platform play, even if they could serve everybody, there are very few companies that can go out with a super horizontal, we do it all, right, because it's not meaningful.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">So what that positioning exercise often does is it tells you what you're not and who you serve. And oftentimes, it can shift over time. That's one of the things we try to really tell our CEOs is you got to have a vision of not only who you are today but who you're going to be later because that helps them understand that you can be that everything to everyone in 5 or 6 years. But today, the people you're serving may be in a vertical.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And to get the customer to come in, you really have to verticalize that marketing message because if you say, hey, we can solve all your data science needs, that's meaningless. But if you say something like companies who look just like you, same size, same problems, same vertical, we helped them and we can help you too. That's really meaningful.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And trying to get that positioning where, yes, you have like your umbrella positioning, which is, okay, we're this whizbang, AI data science platform or we're this great fintech company or we're going to get all your health care data in one spot, that's kind of your umbrella in a way.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And then what you have to do is you have to then take that and verticalize it when you hit the market and tell your customer exactly how you're going to help solve their problem.

And so it's been really interesting. We get to see so many different things in the go-to-market, and we've built Canvas around that. We were doing it intuitively. We were helping people solve their go-to-market issues with this network that we had, but we hadn't formalized it.</span></span></p>,\n",

So if you're sick, it's you and you better figure it out because your doctor is not going to come at night trying to sort you out, they're trying to have dinner with their kids or family or whatever. That is just the reality. So I was really drawn to quantified self with all the data out there. It is really, really fascinating. And the continuous glucose monitors really like and all those things.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">I think with quantified self though, you really are sort of serving this end consumer. You're serving the same pocket of people that balance their bank account every month, which is not a lot. You're sort of serving what they call almost like the worried well often. I love it personally. I probably read every book on like diet and nutrition and toxicity.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">I love the microbiome. I think that's really what's going to be the big unlock for neuroscience going forward.

I think the main issue that we look at in terms of cost in this country though, as healthcare costs are continuing to rise, is obesity.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And it's really bad. If you're 50-plus pounds overweight, you then have issues. You have hypertension, you have diabetes, you have sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, the number one care for sleep apnea is lose 10 pounds. That's the big one. And then a lot of the other stuff is at the margin. I'm a personal huge advocate of quantified self and could talk for hours about all the stuff and would love to learn more.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And a lot of times, it's really late, don't need the big math. It's not that you need this big, huge algorithm behind you or data science or AI box, it's not that complicated. Now there are things that are, those are at the margin. I mean I'm from the Midwest, I see it. If I could change anything, I would have us have nutrition in schools. I would make sure the kids are fed and they know how to feed themselves, for goodness' sake.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And when you look at Japan, I mean, they actually do have the kids make the food. I mean what better thing could we be actually having the children do. So when you go back, and you look, and you see even what is available in the grocery stores. In the Midwest, if you go to a small town, the fruit and vegetable selection is pretty minimal.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And then there's tons and tons and tons of carbs and any one in quantified self will tell you exactly what happens when you eat a lot of carbs and your blood sugar spikes, it crashes, and you crave a lot more carbs. I have a personal passion about this. It's probably my second life, but I would love to help solve that.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">But it really starts at the elementary school and preschool level, helping kids understand what they should be eating because we're told these things, we're told, oh, avoid fat, that's really bad for you, but it's really not bad if your brain is 60% fat. You need fat. All your nerves are coated in fat. Now what you don't need is like vegetable oil, that's really a bad idea.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">But guess what, animal fats and avocado oils and all of those, you actually need those badly.

The other thing, of course, is there has to be a big enough market and so you talked about quantified self. It has to be something that the average person can adopt readily and understand.

There has to be a big enough market and the product has to be designed in such a way that people can pick it up and use it. And the ethos of the CEO has to be that they understand that about the consumer, and they're trying to make things much easier for them. And Casetext is a prime example. Casetext is a company that I love, having been a lawyer. Actually, I never practice.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">I don't tell many people I was actually even a lawyer, but I went back after working for about 10 years and got a JD-MBA and took a quick sabbatical with that as I started a family. But Casetext is an interesting company that essentially creates briefs for you, probably the most hardcore artificial intelligence platform in my portfolio, amazing company. So that product market fit, the ease of use, market size. And then it has to be an area where I feel like myself or one of our teams actually can be helpful.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">So it has to be an area of interest because there's a lot of VCs out there.

We believe in you, and we want to help you win.

So we've seen the whole thing. And I remember going down the road like yelling at Siri, trying to find something. And I'm like, no, I said whatever. This is before I sold to Apple when it was just Siri, right? In those days, it was frustrating, but it has come so far. My kids don't know life without Google. They walk in the kitchen in the morning, \"Hey, Google, play me some music. Hey, Google, what is this?\"</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And if it doesn't have the voice interface, they're kind of shocked, right? I look at that and I'm like the assumption at this point is there's a voice interface. And I look at that, and it wasn't that long ago that we had invested in Siri, and it was pretty rough and then also touch, but it's really this voice thing that has just -- it has changed the playing field.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And I look at that, too, and I think about when I do health tech investments and I have a friend at UCSF, she was serving the general population care and what was really interesting to me was her advice. She's like the real cost in health care is not this quantified self-thing, it's really the 10% of people who aren't literate. You look at how many people in this country can't read or write English and then we develop all these whizbang things to help them out.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">Well, voice just breaks that barrier because you can have voice technology in any language and it really is sort of a democratizing agent, I think, for so many things and really opens up the market to everyone. So I think this AI, specifically, with the voice enablement is fascinating. And all of a sudden, things that we had said, hey, that's not possible. It's not going to serve particular parts of our population, well, now it does.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And then macro, when we did LendingClub, it was right after Lehman crash, right? We did Doximity really early because of our belief in what was happening with all the healthcare services and what was happening there. So I look at macro now, and the sands are continuing to shift very quickly and that's when there's a lot of opportunity. When you look at all the money that's just got into this transportation infrastructure bill, it's unbelievable.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">I look at that and I'm like, well, where can we invest there? Like what is something that kind of lines up with us? It reminds me a lot of like the HITECH Act and the Affordable Care Act when we did the first healthtech investment. And so we did Practice Fusion, which was the first cloud based EMR, and it's sold to Allscripts. And it was with the understanding that back in '09, 6% of medical records were digital, believe it or not.</span></span></p>,\n",

And so we got a little bit of government money and that's changed. Again, where the incentives are, are what people do.

I was more worried when everything was just crazily up and to the right for forever, right? So when I entered venture, I've been an operator at P&amp;G and a start-up that went public and I had my own company for a while, and I've seen a lot of cycles. I've seen a couple. NextCard went public, phenomenal, party and then got delisted, right? I've seen it. And I've seen a bunch of those things happen.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And so I came into venture, Lehman crash in October '08. So I came in right when that was happening. I took the bar and then came into venture. I had other things I was looking at, but I was so excited to come into venture because I saw the opportunity that market has just been decimated, everything was frozen and it was a great opportunity because in these times, you actually can build companies, some of the noise kind of goes away.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And we did LendingClub in Q1 of '09, right? I think banks were frozen, nobody was lending to anybody, but it was an opportunity because they were lending to these super prime, prime borrowers. And in any market, in any economy, there is a pocket of super prime and prime that you can lend to very safely. There is a big dislocation and opportunity created that LendingClub was positioned for. So I actually think it's really interesting.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">When I came into venture, too, there were headlines, I would say I should go back and pull them, that venture capital is dead, venture capital is cottage industry, venture capital shouldn't exist. Those were the headlines in late '08 and '09. And I don't even know what my title was at that time, but it wasn't partner.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And I reached out to Dick Kramlich, who founded NEA, and Reid Dennis, who founded IVP and David Morgenthaler, who founded Morgenthaler Ventures. And I said, \"Can you please come and talk to people in my generation and just maybe talk us off the cliff?\"</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And it was hilarious. Like they came and it was pre-partner only, and they went back through their war stories and essentially like, \"Oh yes, every 10 years, venture capital is dead. And those are the best times to be in it. And here's why. And here are the companies I did.\" And they're all like legends, right? It was really interesting. I remember one of them asked, I think Reid Dennis asked people in the audience to hold up their hand if any of them have ever seen a [ carry ] check. Nobody raised their hand, nobody.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">So there has been large slots of time where there were no carry checks, where venture capital effectively was, I wouldn't say dead, but hibernating, right? But those are also the times when these awesome companies were getting built. I think it's just normal. I think if you look back at the cycles of this industry, it is cyclical.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And abnormality is that we were so up and to the right for so long. We should have had a reset a few years before it happened. And so I think for me, I'm excited now in my mind is the time when you can build a great company when people are kind of focused internally and when you can hire. I mean you look at how many companies they are laying people off, and that tide is turning in terms of being able to hire just amazing talent and bring them to your company.</span></span></p>,\n",

I was at a fairly large high school with a very good academic program. And my friend's mom let me live with them for a year.</span></span></p>,\n",
       " <p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">And for me, that was really life changing because I was a first-generation college kid, my parents hadn't gone to college. And they were doctors. So they basically kind of took me under their wing and I had straight As and was top in my class and all that or not like the top, top but very close to the top. And they basically looked at me and they were like, \"What are you doing?\" And really sort of refactored, I think my trajectory in terms of what I thought was possible. So yes, very kind.</span></span></p>,\n",
